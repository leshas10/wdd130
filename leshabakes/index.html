              <h2>About our Family</h2>
              <p>We are so excited that you found our site! Lesha's Cakes and Bakes is a family run adventure that has been in the works for a few years now. I am a mom to 5 wonderful boys and they have such a fun "entrepreneur" mindset. Right along with my husband, the kids are always encouraging me to sell my desserts. Here you will find creations in our kitchen, possible purchase opportunities, and tricks to help you find success in your own kitchen! We will share our fails too, no worries! Are you Gluten Free? Sugar Free? We have some recipes for you as well. Come bake with us!
