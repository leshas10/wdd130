          One thing that brings me joy, is making treats to give away. A recent tradition that we have been doing since making ‘fancy’ cakes, is to let the birthday person decide who to share their cake with. We then bring a good portion of the cake to them, hoping to brighten their day. With sharing, comes the need to learn other baking styles, Gluten Free, sugar free, dairy free... we have had some successes (and fails) with all of those, along with many successes with ALL. THE. SUGAR! I also am not a fan of artificial dyes, which makes it tricky to add colors to my desserts. This week, we will be featuring Cupcakes. The OREO cupcake, A Dairy Free/Dye Free Chocolate Cupcake, and a German Chocolate Cupcake.
